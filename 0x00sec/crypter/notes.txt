What is a crypter & stub?
    A crypter is a program able to encrypt a binary/modify it so 
    that it will decrypt itself at run-time. The stub is the component
    of the modified binary that will decrypt it at runtime.

How does it work?
    The crypter crypts selected parts of the binary and then it
    injects some code and makes sure it gets executed before anything
    else in that binary.

How it does it:
    1) finds the parts of the binary to encrypt (usually .text and 
                                                 .rodatai)
    2) crypts them
    3) injects the stub into the binary
    4) payches the stub and the binary header to ensure the stub
       is properly executed at runtime.

xor encoding:
    For each byte in plain text
        encrypted_value = plain_value ^ Key_Valueo

   >> in C code:

    char key[KEY_LEN];
    char msg[MSG_LEN];
    int i, j;           // Indexes for msg and key respectively
    
    for (i = 0, j = 0; i < MSG_LEN; msg[i++] ^= key[j++], j%=KEY_LEN);

   >> in pseudo code:
    i = 0;
    j = 0;
    do {
        msg[i] = msg[i] ^ key[j];
        i++;   
        j++;
        j = j % KEY_LEN;
    } while (i < MSG_LEN);  

Creating a permutation matrix in C:
    #define SWAP(a,b) a+=b; b=a-b; a-=b;
    
    for (i = 0; i < 255; S[i] = i, i++)
        ;
    for (j = 0, i = 0; i < 256; i++){
        j = (j + S[i] + key[i % klen] ) % 256;
        SWAP(S[i],S[j]);
}
    


a = 30
b = 20
a = 50
b = 50 - 20 = 30
a = 50 - 30 = 20
