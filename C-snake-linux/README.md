# Description: 
This is a spin off of a project that I forked and rewrote. I'm going to add in a means of saving high scores to a file as an additional element. I changed the original use of screen("refresh"), because it was causing a nauseating flickering effect in the terminal. Instead I used a redundant loop to print newlines. It isn't perfect, but I can play the game for more than 10 seconds without mashing CTRL+C. I also changed the snakes head to reflect the direction it is moving in, rather than the original version that just used 'o' for the head of the snake.
