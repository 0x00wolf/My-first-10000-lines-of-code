>Registers
EAX - Accumulator
ECX - Counter
EDX - DATA
EBX - BASE

ESP - Stack Pointer:
Stores a 32-bit address.

EBP - Base Pointer:
Stores a 32-bit address

ESI - Source Index
EDI - Destination Index

EIP - Instruction Pointer:
points to the current insturction the processor is reading.

>Set gdb to Intel Assembly:
gdb -q
set dis instel

>Intel syntax
generally:
operation <destination>, <source>

Destination and source values will either be
a register, a memory address, or a value.

Usually intuitive: mov operation will move a value
from the source to the destination

sub will subtract, inc will increment, etc.

cmd operation is used to compare values.
operation's beginning with j are often jump.

gdb -g ./a.out
set debugging to include extra debugging.

gdb -x <program>
examine command
common format letters
o - Display in octal
x - Display in hexidecimal
u - Display in unsigned, standard base-10 decimal.
t - Display in binary
ex:
(gdb) x/o <memory address>

cmd to get location of the info register:
(gdb) i r eip

A number can be prepended to the format of the
examine command to view multiple targets at once
(gdb) x/2x $eip

The default size of a single unit is a four-byte 
unit called a word. The size of the display units
for the examine command can be changed by adding a
size letter to then end of the format letter.
Valid letters are:
b - single byte
h - halfword/2-bytes
w - word/4-bytes
g - giant/8 bytes

Sometimes a word also refers to 2-byte values.
In this case a double word or DWORD refers to a
4-byte value
