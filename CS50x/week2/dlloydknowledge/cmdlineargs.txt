COMMANDER KEEN LINE ARGUMENTS

//until this moment
    int main(void)

//adding data at runtime rather than while running
    //void fails to do so

to collect cmd line arguments:
int main(int argc, string argv[])
{
    //string argv[] is an array of strings

argc - arguments, an integer type variable and tells you how much stuff the user typed out
argv - argument vector, an array that stores strings
    argv[0] always the name of the program
    argv[argc-1] always the last name. -1 is null.
